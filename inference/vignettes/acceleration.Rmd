This vignette describes the computation vs. inference tradeoffs associated with
using fine-tuning and coresets while bootstrapping.

```{r}
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
library("readr")
```


* Get directories to all the fine-tuned features starting at epoch T
* Get pairwise RVs for features at that level
* Put into a list element
* Repeat for all epochs
* Melt into appropriate data frame and look at histogram
