Many modern datasets don't fit neatly into $n \times p$ matrices, but most techniques
for measuring statistical stability expect rectangular data. This study explores
ways to assess stability in the situation where features must be learned. We
design controlled simulations to characterize the power and practicality of
competing approaches. We illustrate our approach using a spatial
proteomics dataset, where machine learning tools can augment the scientist's
workflow, but where guarantees of statistical reproducibility are still central.
