```{r}
library("ggplot2")
theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(panel.grid=element_blank()))
source("point_process.R")
scale_x_continuous <- function(...) {
  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(..., expand = c(0, 0))
}
scale_y_continuous <- function(...) {
  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(..., expand = c(0, 0))
}
scale_fill_continuous <- function(...) {
  ggplot2::scale_fill_continuous(..., low="white", high="black")
}
```

First, we'll show how to simulate a single image.

```{r}
x <- expand.grid(seq(0.1, 1, 0.05), seq(0.1, 1, 0.05))
intensity <- matern_process(x)
z <- inhomogeneous_process(1000, intensity)
ggplot() +
  geom_tile(aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill = z), intensity) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = X1, y = X2), data.frame(z), col = "red") +
  coord_fixed()

probs <- relative_intensities(x, 4, nu = 1)
mprobs <- melt(probs, id.vars = c("Var1", "Var2"))
marks <- mark_process(z, probs, tau = 1) %>%
  mutate(variable = paste0("X", mark))
ggplot() +
  geom_tile(aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill=value), mprobs) +
  geom_point(aes(x = X1, y = X2, col = mark), marks) +
  facet_wrap(~ variable) +
  coord_fixed()
```

Now, let's think about how we want to link the parameters of image generation to
something like a survival time. This is a specification of all the parameters.

```{r}
x <- expand.grid(seq(0.1, 1, 0.1), seq(0.1, 1, 0.1))
beta_r <- c(-0.5, 0, 0.5)
nu_r <- 1 # smoothness of the relative intensity functions (higher is smoother)
alpha_r <- 0.5 # bandwidth of the relative processes (higher is smoother)
nu <- 2 # smoothness of the overall process
alpha <- 2 # bandwidth of the overall process
tau <- 1 # temperature for the marking (0 -> uniform, inf -> hard assignment)
n_original <- 1000
```

```{r}
result <- sim_wrapper(nu, alpha, beta_r, nu_r, alpha_r, tau)
marks <- result$marks %>%
  mutate(variable = paste0("X", mark))
mprobs <- melt(result$probs, id.vars = c("Var1", "Var2"))
ggplot() +
  geom_tile(aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill=value), mprobs) +
  geom_point(aes(x = X1, y = X2, col = mark), marks) +
  facet_wrap(~ variable) +
  coord_fixed()
```

# Simulating Images

We've sanity checked what all the images look like, when we vary the simulation
parameters. Let's have a way of relating these parameters to an ``outcome''
associated with each image "look." We'll make these assumptions,

* More mixing between cell types is associated with better outcomes
* Less uniform distribution in cell densities is associated with worse outcomes.
* More of the first cell type is better for outcomes, more of the other two is bad.

In particular, we'll make up this equation, for some hypothetical outcome y,

y =  (beta_r[1] - beta_r[2] - beta_r[3]) / 3 + (nu_r + alpha_r + nu + alpha) / 4 - tau + noise

so that the signs are in the intuitive direction and so that no one group of
terms dominates. We'll consider modulating the noise level to gauge the
sensitivity of different approaches.

We'll generate the parameters according to t and gamma distributions (though
they won't be too wild), depending on whether they are allowed to be negative.

```{r}
n_images <- 200
beta_r <- 0.3 * rt(n_images * 3, 5, 0) %>%
  matrix(ncol = 3)
nu_r <- rgamma(n_images, 3, 3)
alpha_r <- rgamma(n_images, 3, 3)
nu <- rgamma(n_images, 5, 3) # overall process is smoother on average
alpha <- rgamma(n_images, 5, 3)
tau <- rbeta(n_images, 1.5, 1.5)

# simulate the response
eps <- 0.1
X <- cbind(beta_r / 3, nu_r / 4, alpha_r / 4, nu / 4, alpha / 4, tau)
y <- X %*% c(1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1) + rnorm(n_images, 0, eps)
```

Now we can simulate all the images.

```{r}
for (i in seq_len(n_images)) {
  result <- sim_wrapper(
    nu[i],
    alpha[i],
    beta_r[i, ],
    nu_r[i],
    alpha_r[i],
    tau[i]
  )

  marks <- result$marks %>%
    mutate(variable = paste0("X", mark))
  mprobs <- melt(result$probs, id.vars = c("Var1", "Var2"))
  ggplot() +
    geom_tile(aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill=value), mprobs) +
    geom_point(aes(x = X1, y = X2, col = mark), marks) +
    facet_wrap(~ variable) +
    coord_fixed()
}
```
