These scripts are what's used to run the simulation and data analysis in this
study. They both rely on the functions in the `stability` and `inference` helper
packages, defined at the top of this repository.

## Simulation


## Data Analysis

First, you have to download the raw MIBI-ToF images from [here], along with the
SummarizedExperiment data from
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qb6VgVkWfy2x5Dr7kzqMAfzOLas1G6v-).
The summarized experiment data gives the expression values and cell categories
for the cells in the original images.
